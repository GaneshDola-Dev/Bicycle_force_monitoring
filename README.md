Embedded Systems • Sensor Integration • STM32 • Real‑Time Data Acquisition
This project presents a custom‑built treadmill‑based bicycle testing platform designed to measure dynamic forces, motor speed, and rotational behavior in real time.
It was developed as part of the ZEETA research initiative, focusing on adaptive control for single‑track electric trailers.

📌 Project Overview
The system integrates:
- A KD40S tri‑axial force sensor for real‑time force measurement
- A precision‑modified treadmill motor for controlled bicycle testing
- An infrared slot sensor for rotation and RPM detection
- An STM32G431 Nucleo‑64 microcontroller for embedded processing
- A 0.96‑inch RGB OLED display (SSD1357) for live visualization
The goal is to analyze bicycle dynamics under controlled conditions and support research in adaptive trailer control, safety, and performance optimization.
